You can now connect Monosi up to your BigQuery instance and start monitoring your datawarehouse. More information can be found [here](/docs/integrations/bigquery). \\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/datasource/bigquery_connection.png\\" alt=\\"BigQuery Integration\\" />\\n\\n## UI Updates\\n\\nWe have added a new Issues page to the UI to have an easier view of any anomalies that occur within your data. Also, an onboarding form has been added and appears only the first time the application is launched. \\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/changelog/v011/issues_page.png\\" alt=\\"Issues Page\\" />\\n<img src=\\"/img/changelog/v011/onboarding_form.png\\" alt=\\"Onboarding Form\\" />\\n\\n## New metrics functionality\\n\\nA new metric \\"Freshness\\" has been added to the table health metric arsenal. This checks the freshness of data in table timestamp columns. More information can be found [here](/docs/user-guide/table-health).\\n\\nFurthermore, the way Monosi looks at previous data has been changed. Previously, we required a timestamp column in order to look back at a day of data. Now, we perfrom a sampling of existing data to understand trends. This results in Monosi working on any table, even ones without a timestamp. \\n\\n## Integration Support \\n\\nThe Slack alerting integration has been improved and anomaly messages have been condensed into one singular message. \\nWe have also added support for webhook alerts. More information can be found [here](/docs/integrations/webhooks).\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/integrations/webhook_alert.png\\" alt=\\"Webhook Alert\\" />\\n\\n### Documentation\\n\\nWe are constantly improving the project documentation. With this releas we have added Algolia search and more content about the project. \\n\\nIf you have any questions about the documentation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/monosidev/monosi/issues) or message us in [Slack](https://monosi.dev/slack).\\n\\n### Testing & Bug fixes\\n\\nWith this release we decreased the docker file size, making it faster to download and/or build locally. \\n\\nAlso, we have solved a few bugs surrounding execution timestamps and zscore calculations. Further, more tests have been added to ensure the reliability of the code."},{"id":"v010-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/changelog/v010-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/monosidev/monosi/tree/master/documentation/changelog/2022-04-01-v010-release.md","source":"@site/changelog/2022-04-01-v010-release.md","title":"v0.1.0 Release","description":"Monosi v0.1.0 Release","date":"2022-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 1, 2022","tags":[{"label":"releases","permalink":"/changelog/tags/releases"}],"readingTime":1.155,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Unkrich","title":"Co-founder","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15347345?v=4"}],"prevItem":{"title":"v0.1.1 Release","permalink":"/changelog/v011-release"}},"content":"Monosi v0.1.0 Release\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\nMonosi\'s v0.1.0 release brings a new UI, ease of use & deployment, and much more.\\n\\n### Web Application & UI\\n\\nIn order to use the Monosi application, a web frontend and server are provided to add data sources, receive alerts, and view data quality analysis of the monitors that are running.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Monosi Release\\" class=\\"case-study-header\\" src=\'/img/example.gif\' />\\n\\n## Automatic Scheduler\\n\\nBuilt-in scheduling is provided out of the box with Monosi so that you can set it and forget it - until you receive an alert - or choose to view regularly up-to-date data at any time.\\n\\n## Profiler\\n\\nBuilt-in profiling allows for the automatic creation of data monitors and quality checks when a data source is added.\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\nDeploying has been simplified with Docker and Docker Compose.
